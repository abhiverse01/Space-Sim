Integrating a neural network into your gravity simulation can be an interesting way to approximate the complex gravitational interactions between celestial bodies. This approach might not be as accurate as solving Newton's laws of motion directly, but it can offer insights into how machine learning models can approximate physical systems.

### Steps to Integrate a Neural Network

1. **Training Data Generation**: We'll generate a dataset by simulating gravitational interactions using Newton's law of gravitation over a range of initial conditions.

2. **Neural Network Model**: We'll create a neural network model that takes the positions and velocities of celestial bodies as input and predicts the forces acting on them.

3. **Simulation Using Neural Network**: Instead of directly calculating gravitational forces using Newton's law in the `attraction` method, we'll use the trained neural network to predict the forces.

### Explanation:

1. **Neural Network (`GravityNet`)**:
    - A simple feedforward neural network is used to predict the gravitational forces between two bodies.
    - The input to the network is the normalized positions and masses of two bodies.
    - The output is the force in the x and y directions.

2. **Training Data**:
    - Training data is generated by calculating the gravitational force between randomly initialized celestial bodies using Newton's law.
    - The input data is normalized to improve the neural network's training efficiency.

3. **Using the Neural Network**:
    - The `attraction` method in `HeavenlyBody` uses the trained neural network to predict the gravitational forces instead of calculating them directly.

4. **Training the Model**:
    - The model is trained with a simple training loop using MSE (Mean Squared Error) as the loss function and the Adam optimizer.

### Notes:

- This approach adds complexity to the simulation but may offer insights into how neural networks can approximate physical laws.
- The neural network's accuracy will depend on the quality and quantity of the training data, so you might need to experiment with different training sets and architectures.

This neural network integration is a fun way to blend traditional physics simulation with modern AI techniques. You can further enhance it by experimenting with more complex network architectures, adding more training data, or refining the model training process.
